            { text: "Only women can get breast cancer.", answer: false, explanation: "This is a myth. While breast cancer is much more common in women, men can also develop breast cancer, though it's rare (about 1% of all breast cancer cases)." },
            { text: "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide.", answer: true, explanation: "This is a fact. Breast cancer is indeed the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women globally, affecting millions each year." },
            { text: "Wearing a bra causes breast cancer.", answer: false, explanation: "This is a myth. There is no scientific evidence linking bra wearing to breast cancer risk. This myth has been thoroughly debunked by medical research." },
            { text: "Regular self-examination can help detect breast cancer early.", answer: true, explanation: "This is a fact. Monthly self-exams help women become familiar with their breasts and can help detect changes early, though they should complement, not replace, clinical exams." },
            { text: "Breast cancer only affects older women.", answer: false, explanation: "This is a myth. While risk increases with age, breast cancer can occur in younger women too. Early detection is crucial for all age groups." },
            { text: "Mammograms are the most effective screening tool for breast cancer.", answer: true, explanation: "This is a fact. Mammography is the gold standard for breast cancer screening and can detect tumors before they can be felt." },
            { text: "Antiperspirants cause breast cancer.", answer: false, explanation: "This is a myth. Scientific studies have found no link between antiperspirant use and breast cancer risk." },
            { text: "Family history is a significant risk factor for breast cancer.", answer: true, explanation: "This is a fact. Having a first-degree relative (mother, sister, daughter) with breast cancer approximately doubles a woman's risk." },
            { text: "Breast cancer is always painful.", answer: false, explanation: "This is a myth. Early-stage breast cancer is often painless. Pain is not a reliable indicator of breast cancer presence or absence." },
            { text: "Breastfeeding reduces the risk of breast cancer.", answer: true, explanation: "This is a fact. Breastfeeding for 12 months or longer can reduce breast cancer risk, especially for hormone-receptor-negative breast cancers." },
            { text: "All breast lumps are cancerous.", answer: false, explanation: "This is a myth. Most breast lumps are benign (non-cancerous). However, any new lump should be evaluated by a healthcare provider." },
            { text: "Exercise can help reduce breast cancer risk.", answer: true, explanation: "This is a fact. Regular physical activity can reduce breast cancer risk by 10-20%, especially in postmenopausal women." },
            { text: "Breast cancer is contagious.", answer: false, explanation: "This is a myth. Breast cancer is not contagious and cannot be spread from person to person through contact." },
            { text: "Early detection improves survival rates significantly.", answer: true, explanation: "This is a fact. When breast cancer is detected early (localized stage), the 5-year survival rate is over 99%." },
            { text: "Only women with large breasts get breast cancer.", answer: false, explanation: "This is a myth. Breast size does not affect cancer risk. Women of all breast sizes can develop breast cancer." },
            { text: "Hormone replacement therapy can increase breast cancer risk.", answer: true, explanation: "This is a fact. Long-term use of combined estrogen and progestin hormone therapy can increase breast cancer risk." },
            { text: "Breast cancer always requires a mastectomy.", answer: false, explanation: "This is a myth. Many women with breast cancer can have breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy) followed by radiation therapy." },
            { text: "Menopause increases breast cancer risk.", answer: true, explanation: "This is a fact. The risk of breast cancer increases with age, and most breast cancers occur in women over 50 (postmenopausal)." },
            { text: "Stress causes breast cancer.", answer: false, explanation: "This is a myth. While stress affects overall health, there's no direct evidence that stress alone causes breast cancer." },
            { text: "Genetic testing can identify high-risk individuals.", answer: true, explanation: "This is a fact. Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations can identify women at very high risk for breast cancer." }
